#C.R.U.D. Blog
### Molly Kent & Zach Gordon

This assignment was to create a simple CRUD application that will allow a user to create, read, update, and delete blog posts from the application. There are two different views - one a list of available blog posts, the other a detail view of the blog post. We did not have to worry about authentication or user management for this assignment.

The requirements were: 
1. Semantically correct HTML 
2. Images will be cropped and compressed correctly 
3. Flexible CSS measurements
4. Clean, maintainable JavaScript
5. After checking out the repository, a user must be able to run npm install and gulp serve in order to access the application locally
6. Plugins are allowed, but must be described and justified
7. No jQuery

We modeled our code after Mike's ng-soccer app, refactored to handle blog posts.
